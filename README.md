# Cities_Skylines-EPIC-ModInstaller
Just a small script to Help people to get mods on Cities: Skylines without hour long copy pasting


Pre-Instructions:

  If you want mods on *Cities: Skylines* Epic Games Version you need to get them from some sort of Steam Workshop Downloader like https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/
  
  After you downloaded the Mods you need to extract every single .zip file and paste it in the Correct Folder. Thats time consuming!
  
  I made a very small script that automates this process.
  
Instructions:

  1. You need Python and Pip installed on your machine.

  2. Install the following library with pip:
  pip install time
  
  3. Make 2 Separate Folders, and sort the Mods in one and the Assets in the Other:
     HELP: If you see .dll files in the ZIP it means that this is a MOD.
           If you see .crp files in the ZIP it means that this is a ASSET.
  
  3. Start the Script and enter the Paths needed:
     WARNING: Replace the \ with / to prevent the script from crashing!
     Example: F:\Cities_Skylines_Mods\MODS <-- BAD
              F:/Cities_Skylines_Mods/MODS <-- GOOD
              
  4. The Script will paste extract the .zip files and paste it in the desired folder.

  5. Start your game and enjoy the Mods.
